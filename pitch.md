#Pitching Your Idea

Whenever a Founder explains their idea in a Working Group session or in a Hotseat, they should always look to answer five things:

1: What does your company do and what need does it serve?

"Anastasia makes fashionable staplers for the global office workers to add character to the work environment."

2: What is the market size for your offering?

"Over 20 MM staplers are sold worldwide each year in the $20 billion office products marketplace."

3: What do you have that makes you unique as compared to your competition?

"Anastasia has developed manufacturing relationships that allow the company to produce low quantities of fashionable staplers and generate 30% gross margins, and the company has secured eight of the top ten fashion designers to release a stapler line."
4: Where are you in your growth plans?

"The company has already sold 10,000 fashionable staplers through an online storefront and closed a distribution deal with Staplers-R-Us."

5: What are you looking to raise and what will the money be used for?

"Anastasia is looking to raise $1 MM on a $3.5 MM pre-money valuation to have ten of the top fifteen national retailers carry the fashionable staplers."

Here are five key tips on pitching at the Founder Institute:

Avoid Useless Words: Entrepreneurs commonly use superlatives when describing their own business, such as "XYZ has the best staplers in the entire world." This detracts from the credibility of the statements. Most descriptions include useless adjectives and phrases that bulk up simple statements, such as "XYZ has developed over an elongated period and under the supervision of world-class engineers the process to both quickly and efficiently mass-produce staplers at various quantities."

Keep It Short: You should be able to explain your company in 5 to 10 sentences that takes a couple of minutes to present. If you want to succeed, make sure that your written pitch impresses your Working Group first, then videotape yourself giving the pitch. Watch the video and write down everything that you want to improve in a list. Repeat this process until you are happy with the results. At the end of your pitch, say: "does anyone have questions that I can help you with?" The shorter your pitch, the more questions that will you have, and more questions are good.

Answer Briefly: Answer every question with one or two sentences and with as few words as possible. Uncomfortable silence is a tool that you can use to elicit another question. If you do not have or know an answer, say: "I don't recall the answer to that off the top of my head, can I look it up in my files and get back to you through email." Questions are an excellent sign of interest and engagement. When an investor gets into 'question mode,' they usually have a series of 5 to 10 questions that they need answered quickly to evaluate the opportunity. You are doing well in a pitch when the investors are talking.

Ask for Feedback: Make sure to leave a couple minutes to collect feedback. Ask the investors, 'do you have any recommendations for the business?' Have a pen and paper out, and write down everything that the investors say. It's a common courtesy to take notes, and it's expected. After an investor says something, say 'thank you.' Do not get defensive. Nothing sours a relationship faster than getting into a debate.

Be the Expert: You should read every recent blog post and know about every key development in the primary industry and all related industries to your idea. There is more than a 50% chance that an investor will have seen and researched a very similar idea within the last 45 days. It is also very likely that this investor will ask you about mundane developments or other companies in the field as a test of your knowledge and to show off their own expertise. When confronted, you say, 'Yes, I was aware of that. Thank you.' This will lead to more questions.
